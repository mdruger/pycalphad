    Na√Øve algorithm to map a binary phase diagram in T-X
    for each temperature, proceed along increasing composition, skipping two phase regions
    assumes conditions in T and X
    Right now, this is assumed to be a binary system, but it's feasible to accept
    a set of constraints in the conditions for compositions that specify an
    ispleth in multicomponent space, and this code will transform so that X
    follows the path with the constraints, transforming the equilibrium hyperplanes
    as necessary.
